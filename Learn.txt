1.  Change the default messages.properties filename to something else
=====================================================================
In application.yml:
spring:
  messages:
    basename: validation-messages

2.  ✅ Issue with @CreationTimestamp and @UpdateTimestamp not populating immediately
    While creating a new category, I noticed that the createdAt and updatedAt fields were coming back as null in the response,
    even though they were annotated with @CreationTimestamp and @UpdateTimestamp in the entity (BaseEntity).
    The reason is that these annotations are handled by Hibernate during the flush phase — not at the time of save().
    Since I wasn't flushing the persistence context (e.g., using saveAndFlush()),
    the timestamps hadn't been generated yet when mapping the entity to a DTO for the response.

    ✅ How I fixed it
    1. Use saveAndFlush()
    2. Manually set createdAt and updatedAt
    3. Use @PrePersist and @PreUpdate in BaseEntity (✅)
